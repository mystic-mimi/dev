description: As Mimi ventures to “The Swirling Pools”, she will learn her CASTE. This is her position of seniority in her CLAN. The village elders will carry the most respect and have the most influence (or voting rights) in their CLAN. However, a mutiny from tribal warriors, an embargo from diplomats or a curse from witches will easily overturn this control.

description2: The hierarchy gives more voting rights to the NFT holder, granting them more influence within the Mystic Mimi Collection. The final stage of Mimi’s journey to “The Swirling Pools” will reveal the true value of each NFT, rewarding holders greatly.
