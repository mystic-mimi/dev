                                How did Mimi get lost on the Solana blockchain? It all started when a group of storytellers and designers were just about to finish their 
                                anime series, with Mimi as the main character. When creating the series, Mimi was always mysterious and mercurial, as if she has a mind of her own.

                            <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">
                                It was late one evening, when the artists had finished their final scene. After letting the paint dry overnight, they returned to final the project 
                                complete; with one exception. Mimi had disappeared from all of the scenes. Had she been banished by an enemy? Had she run away in search of a better 
                                life? Was she looking for a lover, a friend or a conquest?

                                The reason Mimi transported to the Solana blockchain is not understood, but what is clear is that she has picked up special powers. She must now learn 
                                to both survive in her new environment and also control her new found powers!
