            <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">If you hold a New World Explorer NFT, you will be rewarded at zero cost! We are planning to release backgrounds for Mimi approximately 6 weeks after initial launch. At the moment, everyone will be able to claim a free background on our website. If you want a different background, simply trade or sell yours on the secondary marketplace. <br>
            We will then allow you to merge the two NFTs to give Mimi a home on the blockchain!</h3>

        <button class="accordion">What is Solana?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">
            Solana is a decentralized blockchain built to enable scalable and user-friendly transactions. 3 reasons why we think Solana is awesome; 
            <ul></ul>
            <ul>
            1. Low gas fees! Solana's scalability ensures transactions remain less than $0.01 for both developers and users. The average cost per transaction is $0.00025!
            </ul>
            <ul>
            2. All about speed! Solana has a 400 millisecond block times and no cencorship, meaning that transactions will never be stopped and will always happen instantly (almost)!
            </ul>
            <ul>
            3. Carbon neutral! The Solana Foundation recently announced that the blockchain is carbon neutral, thanks to carbon offsets. 
            </ul>
            <ul></ul>
            This is why we think Solana will be the most dominant cryptocurrency and blockchain!
