        <div class="panel">
        <p>If you hold a New World Explorer NFT, you will be rewarded at zero cost! We are planning to release backgrounds for Mimi approximately 6 weeks after initial launch. At the moment, everyone will be able to claim a free background on our website. If you want a different background, simply trade or sell yours on the secondary marketplace. <br>
            We will then allow you to merge the two NFTs to give Mimi a home on the blockchain!</p>

        <div class="panel">
        <p>Whitelist is available for members of our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/uNEVvRmaE8" style="color:#f1a92c"><strong>Discord</strong></a> server. We will reward active members who contribute to making our community feel inclusive and enjoyable with whitelist spots. This will reserve people the ability to mint our NFTs early. </p>

        <button class="accordion">What is Solana?</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p>Solana is a decentralized blockchain built to enable scalable and user-friendly transactions. 3 reasons why we think Solana is awesome; 
            <br>
            1. Low gas fees! Solana's scalability ensures transactions remain less than $0.01 for both developers and users. The average cost per transaction is $0.00025!
            <br>
            2. All about speed! Solana has a 400 millisecond block times and no cencorship, meaning that transactions will never be stopped and will always happen instantly (almost)!
            <br>
            3. Carbon neutral! The Solana Foundation recently announced that the blockchain is carbon neutral, thanks to carbon offsets. 
            <br>
            This is why we think Solana will be the most dominant cryptocurrency and blockchain!
